I am an AI Engineer and Researcher currently working at Novomind as part of the AI team. My experience bridges both industrial R&D and academic research, having completed research assistantships at Tsukuba University in Neuroinformatics and Data Engineering, as well as internships at Dell Technologies and Orange Business.

Currently, I am expanding my industrial experience by developing highly available, scalable, end-to-end enterprise AI applications that bring cutting-edge research into real-world deployment.

My core interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Neuroinformatics, Data Engineering, and Large Language Models (LLMs) — particularly in exploring how intelligent systems can enhance decision-making and human-AI interaction.

I’m also passionate about mentorship and knowledge sharing — feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss ideas, research collaborations, or AI-driven solutions!

<!-- I am actively seeking research and professional opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to impactful projects. -->
