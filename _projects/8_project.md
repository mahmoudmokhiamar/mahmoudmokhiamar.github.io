Developed an Explainable AI system for classifying dementia stages using brain MRI scans.

- Trained a custom CNN model, achieving 92% F1 Score.
- Applied Grad-CAM to highlight important brain regions influencing the model's predictions.
- Focused on improving interpretability and trust in medical AI models.
