Developed a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

- Preprocessed and visualized 200GB of ASL video data with landmark extraction using MediaPipe.
- Trained a SqueezeFormer-based model achieving 89% similarity score on validation sets.
- Built a low-latency real-time pipeline to recognize ASL gestures efficiently.
- Mapped recognized gestures to natural language queries and retrieved answers via RAG.
- Visualized gesture embeddings and model predictions interactively using Neptune.
